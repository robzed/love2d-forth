#  Lua Forth or ForthLua

## Basic Concepts

Forth based, looks a bit like Lua:

### Forth based:

* Seperated by Spaces
* Use stack for paramters normally
* can be used to compile and intepret
* immediate excution via commadn line
* build up in stages
* build in assembers (for different targets)


### Lua Look and Feel
 
 * Lua keywords
 * String.format support
 * Defered excution of primitives
 
for do - where 
if then - where 

### Other characterstics
* No normal Forth words - not bound by Forth conventions
* can cross compile and native compile
* UTF-8 names for everything (should be ok, it's Forth, after all)

### Targetting:
* PC (Mac, Linux, Windows)
* ZX Spectrum
* Embeded devices

### Stuff for ZX Spectrum

* Switch between 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit modes for stack and arithmetic mode
